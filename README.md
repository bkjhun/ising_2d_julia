# ising_2d_julia
Julia codes for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of 2 diemnsional Ising model

* **data_analysis.ipynb** uses previously computed data of correlation time, average and variance of magnetization, average and variance of energy.
* **ising_2d_timing.ipynb** measures time required to perform MCMC.

# Results
Random-site flipping dynamics has around x4 correlation time compared to typewriter flipping dynamics.

## Critical exponents

* &nu; = 1.0
* &beta; = 0.125
* &gamma; = 1.75
